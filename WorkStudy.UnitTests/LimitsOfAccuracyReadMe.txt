Hey Billy,

Also - can we add a limits of accuracy check. This just shows that you have reached the required number of observations for a given activity. I was thinking maybe like the “observed” field we could say “total observation total met” or summit.

For each activity we will need the following equation:

where n = the number of observations needed for each activity.

p = the percentage occurrence of this activity against all the other activities. (we don’t know this at the start of the study and it changes with each observation tout)

Anyway don’t think you need to know that but the equation:

n=4p(100-p)/L x L 

L is the limit of accuracy required - we can set this at 10 so the equation:

n=4p(100-P)/100

As long as any activity has reached or passed the n value it is deemed to be accurate to the limits set (=/-10% above)

Eg: fRolling a die we would expect 1 in 6 (17%) for say a 2 to come up

n= 4 x 17 (100 - 17) / 100

n = 68 x 83 /100

number of observations req on that activity = 56
